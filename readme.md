**ScratchPad** is a JavaScript app that uses [localForage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage) to store & persist data locally. It was built as a demo for [git@me issue 25](http://gitat.me/2014/02/27/The_Client_Side_Is_Always_Right.html) and uses Lee Munroe's [Nice Button](https://github.com/leemunroe/nice-button).
